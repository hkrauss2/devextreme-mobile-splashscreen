DevExtreme Mobile App With Custom Splash Screen

DevExtreme Mobile (a.k.a. PhoneJS - I think?) is awesome! I've used it in several projects wrapped in Cordova (a.k.a. PhoneGap - I think? I'm so confused) with success. One thing I noticed is that after the native splash screen displays there is a period of time before the first DevExtreme view displays. In my case I created the app, pulled breeze metadata / initial lookups and then navigated to the first view resulting in a couple seconds of a blank white screen. This repository just shows one possible way to spice things up.

It is based off of "Your First Mobile App" source found here
